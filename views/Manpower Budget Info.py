st.markdown("""
The **manpower budget** is a structured annual planning process used by organizations to estimate the required workforce and the total personnel cost for the upcoming financial year. It combines workforce planning, financial forecasting, and organizational strategy to ensure that staffing levels, skills, and compensation align with business needs.

🔍 Purpose of the Manpower Budget

The manpower budget helps the organization:

Ensure adequate staffing for operations, projects, and growth plans

Forecast salary expenses, allowances, and employer contributions

Control and plan the organization’s largest cost category: personnel

Align human resources planning with production, sales, and strategic targets

Provide leadership with reliable, data-driven cost projections

Prepare for upcoming changes: expansions, automation, restructurings, or new departments

🧩 Key Components of the Manpower Budget
1. Headcount Planning

A detailed projection of:

Current active employees at year start

Expected hires (planned, replacements, growth roles)

Expected departures (retirements, resignations, contract expiries)

Internal movements (promotions, transfers, job changes)

The output defines the workforce structure for the next fiscal year.

2. Compensation Forecasting

A complete estimation of total payroll costs, typically including:

Fixed Pay

Base salaries

Adjustments and increments

Seniority or tenure-based increases

Variable Pay / Allowances

Role-based or operational allowances

Transportation, meal, and shift allowances

Overtime expectations (where applicable)

Employer Costs

Social security contributions

Health insurance

Pension fund contributions

Bonuses

Holiday bonuses (April, July, December)

Performance bonuses (if applicable)

This component delivers a full monthly and annual cost forecast per employee.

3. Pro-Rated Calculations

The manpower budget accounts for employees who:

Join mid-year

Leave before year-end

Change roles with different salary structures

Move between divisions or departments

Switch contract types (e.g., part-time → full-time)

This ensures accurate and fair cost allocation.

4. Organizational Breakdown

The budget provides detailed cost segmentation:

Company level

Division level (Production, Logistics, Finance, HR, etc.)

Department level

Cost center level

Job role / grade level

This allows managers to understand where labor costs are generated and how changes impact their areas.

5. Month-by-Month Projection

Instead of an annual lump sum, most manpower budgets include:

Monthly headcount

Monthly salary cost per employee

Seasonal variations (e.g., production cycles)

Bonus months

Employer contribution fluctuations

This supports cash flow planning and monthly financial accuracy.

📅 How the Manpower Budget Process Works
Step 1 — Data Collection

HR gathers and validates:

Employee master data

Salary structures

Allowances and benefits

Contract details

Planned workforce changes

Step 2 — Parameter Definition

HR and Finance define:

Salary increase policies

Allowance rules

Contribution rates

Hiring plans and replacement policies

Step 3 — Projection & Simulation

Using the defined rules, the organization calculates:

Monthly cost per employee

Annual cost per department

Planned vs actual staffing levels

Financial impact of changes (hire, exit, raise)

Step 4 — Review & Adjustments

Department managers and Finance review:

Cost accuracy

Necessity of new positions

Compliance with budget limits

Alignment with operating targets

Step 5 — Approval & Finalization

Leadership approves the final manpower budget, and it becomes the official:

Headcount plan

Salary cost plan

Workforce strategy for the year

🎯 Why the Manpower Budget Is Critical

A well-executed manpower budget ensures:

Financial control over personnel costs

Predictability in cash flow and payroll planning

Consistency in workforce decisions

Optimal staffing without over- or under-hiring

Strategic alignment between HR, Finance, and operational teams

It is one of the core tools for managing workforce efficiency and financial stability.
